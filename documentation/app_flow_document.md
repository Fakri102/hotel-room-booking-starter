# App Flow Document for Hotel Room Booking Application

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A brand-new visitor lands on the application by opening the public URL in their browser. They first see a simple landing page that features a list of available rooms with a date selector and a prompt to either sign in or sign up. When the visitor clicks the sign-up link, they are taken to a form where they enter their name, email address, and password. Upon submitting the account creation form, the application validates the input and then stores the new user record in the database. If the visitor already has an account, they can click the sign-in link to enter their email and password; after a successful login, they are redirected to their personal dashboard. If the user forgets their password, a “Forgot Password” link takes them to a reset page where they enter their email. The system sends a reset link via email that brings them back to a secure form where they can choose a new password. On signing out, the session is invalidated and the user returns to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After logging in, the application directs the user to the main dashboard. Administrators see a sidebar with links labeled “Rooms,” “Bookings,” “Availability,” and “Profile.” Regular users see “Browse Rooms,” “My Bookings,” and “Profile.” In both cases, the top header displays the application logo, a greeting with the user’s name, and a logout button. The central area of the page shows summary widgets: administrators see total rooms registered and current occupancy, while regular users see their upcoming reservations. The sidebar provides clear navigation to other sections, and clicking any menu item updates the main content area without a full page reload, ensuring a smooth experience.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When an administrator clicks “Rooms” in the sidebar, the page transitions to a list of all registered rooms. A button labeled “Add Room” appears above the list. Clicking it opens a full-page form asking for room number, type, capacity, price per night, and any notes. When the admin submits this form, the client code sends a POST request to the `/api/rooms` endpoint. The server authenticates the user as an admin, validates the data, and writes the new room record to the database. On success, the form closes and the room list updates to include the new entry. Editing or deleting a room launches a similar dialog with pre-filled data, and the corresponding PATCH or DELETE request is sent to the same API collection of routes.

Regular users who click “Browse Rooms” see a public-facing page with a date range selector at the top. Once dates are chosen, the page fetches available rooms from the `/api/availability` endpoint and displays them in a grid. Each room card features a photograph, basic details, and a “Book Now” button. Clicking that button while signed in opens a booking form that confirms the room selection, allows entry of payment details if required, and asks for a final confirmation. When the form is submitted, the client sends a POST request to `/api/bookings`. The server verifies the requested dates against existing reservations using a conflict check. If no overlap exists, the booking is saved and the user is redirected to a confirmation page showing the reservation details. If the booking conflicts, an error message is shown and the user can adjust the dates or choose a different room.

From the booking confirmation page, the user can click “My Bookings” in the sidebar or header menu to see a list of all their current and past reservations. Each entry provides details and a cancel button for upcoming stays. Canceling a booking sends a DELETE request to `/api/bookings/<bookingId>`, and once the server removes the record, the booking disappears from the list.

## Settings and Account Management
Every user has access to a “Profile” section from the sidebar or header. In the profile page, they see their name, email address, and password fields. To update personal information, the user edits the name or email field and clicks “Save Changes.” The application sends a PATCH request to `/api/users/me`, updates the database, and then displays a success notification. To change the password, the user enters the current password and a new password. After submission, the server verifies the current password and, if correct, updates it. Users can also toggle email notification preferences on this page. After making changes, they use the navigation menu or logo in the header to return to the main dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If a form is submitted with missing or invalid data, inline validation errors appear next to each field, and the user cannot proceed until the issues are fixed. During network outages, the application shows a banner indicating loss of connectivity and disables form submissions until the connection is restored. When a user without admin privileges attempts to access an admin-only page, they see a 403 Forbidden page with a link back to their dashboard. If a user manually navigates to a URL that does not exist, a 404 Not Found page appears with a link to the home page. In the booking flow, if the server detects an overlapping reservation, it returns an error and the client displays a message explaining the conflict with options to pick new dates.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A first-time visitor arrives at the landing page and explores available rooms. They sign up with their email and password, verify their account, and sign in. After login, regular users browse rooms by date, complete bookings, and view or cancel those bookings in their dashboard. Administrators follow a parallel path: they sign in, access the protected dashboard, register new rooms via a form, edit or remove rooms, and monitor occupancy through an availability view. Throughout everyday usage, both user types manage their settings from the profile page, recover forgotten passwords if needed, and rely on clear messages when errors occur. This flow ensures a seamless experience from account creation to the core goals of room registration, empty room monitoring, and booking management.
