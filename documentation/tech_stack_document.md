# Tech Stack Document for Hotel Room Booking Application

This document explains, in everyday language, the reasons behind each technology chosen for the hotel room booking project. It’s designed so that anyone—technical or not—can understand how everything fits together and why these tools were selected.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

These are the tools we use to build what you see and interact with in your browser.

- Next.js (App Router)
  • A framework that handles both page routing (how you navigate) and server-powered data fetching. It helps pages load quickly and ensures search engines can find your content easily.

- React & React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
  • React is the library for building user interfaces. Hooks are simple functions that let components remember things (like form inputs) and react to changes (such as data loading).

- TypeScript
  • A version of JavaScript that adds clear labels to data (types). This helps developers catch mistakes early, making the app more reliable.

- shadcn/ui Components
  • A pre-built set of buttons, forms, tables, and other building blocks. They look good, work well on all devices, and save development time.

- Tailwind CSS
  • A styling toolkit made of small utility classes (like `bg-blue-500` or `text-center`). It lets us design layouts and colors quickly without writing custom CSS from scratch.

- Dark Mode Support
  • Built-in toggle between light and dark themes for better comfort and accessibility.

How these choices enhance the user experience:
- Faster page loads and SEO-friendly content with Next.js Server Components.
- Consistent, responsive design using shadcn/ui and Tailwind.
- Fewer bugs and clearer code thanks to TypeScript.

## 2. Backend Technologies

These power everything that happens behind the scenes—storing data, running business logic, and securing access.

- Next.js API Routes
  • Server endpoints living alongside the pages. They handle requests like creating a room or booking a reservation.

- Better Auth (Authentication Library)
  • Manages sign-up, sign-in, and session tracking. It also lets us assign special permissions (an `isAdmin` flag) so only administrators can register or manage rooms.

- PostgreSQL Database
  • A robust system for storing structured information: users, rooms, bookings, and their relationships.

- Drizzle ORM
  • A tool that connects TypeScript code to PostgreSQL. It ensures safe, type-checked database queries, reducing runtime errors when reading or writing data.

- Zod (Data Validation Library)
  • Checks that incoming data (for example, a new room’s price or booking dates) follow the correct format and rules before saving to the database.

How these components work together:
1. A user submits a form in the browser.
2. Next.js API route receives the data and runs Zod to confirm it’s valid.
3. Better Auth checks if the user is logged in (and an admin, if required).
4. Drizzle talks to PostgreSQL to read or write the data.
5. The API responds, and the frontend updates accordingly.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

This section covers where the code lives, how it’s built, and how it goes live.

- Git & GitHub (Version Control)
  • Tracks every change in the code, enabling collaboration and safe updates.

- Docker & Docker Compose
  • Encapsulates the application and database in containers. This ensures that everyone on the team—regardless of their local machine setup—runs the same environment.

- CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
  • Automatically runs tests, builds the code, and deploys it when changes are merged. This reduces human error and speeds up releases.

- Hosting Platform (e.g., Vercel)
  • A cloud service optimized for Next.js apps. It handles serverless functions (API routes), static assets, and scaling automatically.

How these decisions help:
- Consistent development setup with Docker.
- Safe, automated deployments with CI/CD.
- Reliable performance and infinite scaling with a managed host.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

We connect with outside services to add functionality without reinventing the wheel.

- Better Auth (Authentication Service)
  • Securely manages user accounts, passwords, and sessions.

- (Optional) Analytics Tools (e.g., Google Analytics)
  • Track visitor behaviors, page views, and conversions to help improve the service.

- (Optional) Email Service (e.g., SendGrid)
  • Send confirmation emails when a user signs up or booking is confirmed.

Why we use them:
- Offload complex, security-sensitive tasks (like login and email) to specialized providers.
- Focus on core features—room registration and availability—rather than building every service from scratch.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve put in place measures to keep data safe and ensure the app runs smoothly.

Security Measures:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  • The `isAdmin` flag prevents unauthorized users from altering rooms or bookings.

- Environment Variables (`.env` files)
  • Store secrets like database passwords and API keys outside of the code.

- Input Validation with Zod
  • Guards against bad or malicious data reaching the database.

Performance Optimizations:
- Server Components in Next.js
  • Fetch and render data on the server to reduce browser work and speed up page loads.

- Caching Strategies
  • Leverage built-in Next.js caching to avoid repeated database queries for static or infrequently changing data.

- Database Indexing
  • Add indexes on crucial columns (e.g., `roomId`, `checkInDate`) so queries like “find empty rooms” run quickly.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Recap of our key choices and how they support project goals:

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS for a fast, accessible, and attractive interface.
- Backend: Next.js API routes, Better Auth, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, and Zod for secure, type-safe data handling.
- Infrastructure: Git/GitHub, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and a managed hosting platform for reliable development and deployment.
- Integrations: Specialized services for authentication, email, and analytics to streamline non-core features.
- Security & Performance: RBAC, environment variables, server-side rendering, caching, and indexing.

These technologies were chosen to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure hotel room booking application. They allow the team to focus on business logic—registering rooms, monitoring availability, and processing bookings—while relying on proven tools for the rest.
